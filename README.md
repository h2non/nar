# nar [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/h2non/nar.svg?branch=master)][travis] [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nar.svg)][npm] ![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/nar.svg)

Idiomatic application packager utility for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) to **[create](https://gist.github.com/h2non/ad21e0eda698e68e7743) self-contained executable applications** that are **ready-to-ship-and-run**.

nar provides **built-in support** for **creating**, **extracting**, **installing** and **running**
applications easily from a simple [configuration](#configuration) through
a featured [command-line interface](#command-line-interface)
or evented [programmatic API](#programmatic-api).

To get started, see the [features](#features), [basic usage](#basic-usage) or read the [FAQs](#faq).

**Deprecation notice**: `nar` is not longer actively maintained, so I'd encourage you to use [pkg](https://github.com/zeit/pkg) instead, which is pretty much the same, but better.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g nar
```

If you want to use the [programmatic API](#programmatic-api), install it as direct package dependency
```bash
npm install nar --save[-dev]
```

## Basic usage

Creating a new archive (reading metadata from `package.json`)
```bash
nar create
```

Extracting archive files
```bash
nar extract app-0.1.0.nar
```

Running an application archive
```bash
nar run app-0.1.0.nar
```

Installing nar archive (default to `node_modules`)
```bash
nar install app-0.1.0.nar --save[-dev]
```

Installing from remote server is also supported
```bash
nar install http://server.net/app-0.1.0.nar --save[-dev]
```

### Executables

`nar` also provides support for creating **executables binary-like** archives which
has `node/io.js` binary embedded, and therefore, is not required
to have it already installed in the target OS

This is a useful feature when you need to deploy or test
node applications in fresh or isolated servers

Create the executable:
```bash
nar create --executable
> Creates: myapp-0.1.0-linux-x64.nar
```

Then you can run it as simple as:
```bash
chmod +x myapp-0.1.0-linux-x64.nar
./myapp-0.1.0-linux-x64.nar start --args-start='--port 8080 --env dev'
```

If you need to pass custom arguments to your application, instead
of use the `--args-start` flag, you could use the `exec` command directly
```bash
./myapp-0.1.0-linux-x64.nar exec --port 8080 --env dev
```

You can also embed a custom node binary per platform, processor architecture and version
```bash
nar create --executable --os darwin --arch x64 --node 0.12.0
```

```bash
nar create --executable --os darwin --arch x64 --io 1.1.0
```

**Supported platforms**:
- `linux` (x86, x64, armv7l)
- `darwin` (x86, x64, armv7l)
- `sunos` (x86, x64, armv7l)

**Note**: `armv7l` is only available in io.js and linux platform

**Supported `node` versions**:
- `0.8.x`
- `0.9.x`
- `0.10.x`
- `0.11.x`
- `0.12.x`
- `4.x`
- `5.x`
- `6.x`

**Supported `io.js` versions**:
- `1.x`
- `2.x`
- `3.x`

Help: you can build and distribute `nar` executables with auto installer using the [installer](https://github.com/h2non/nar-installer) script

## Configuration

Example `package.json` with full configuration
```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "archive": {
    "dependencies": true,
    "devDependencies": false,
    "globalDependencies": ["npm", "bower", "http-server"],
    "patterns": ["**", "!test/**"]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app --env ${ENV}"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "some": "~0.1.0"
  }
}
```

### Options

Following options can be declared in your application `package.json` as
properties members of the `archive` object

#### dependencies
Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

Include runtime dependencies in the archive, loaded from `package.json`

#### devDependencies
Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Include development dependencies in the archive, loaded from `package.json`

#### peerDependencies
Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

Include peer dependencies in the archive, loaded from `package.json`

#### globalDependencies
Type: `array`
Default: `null`

Include global dependencies in the archive.
It should define an array of strings with packages names

nar will resolve global installed packages (via [requireg][requireg])
and will add them to the archive

Global dependencies will be placed in `.node/lib/node` on archive extraction and them will be
available both via `require` and `PATH` environment variable (for binary files)

#### binary
Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Include the node binary in the nar archive.
This is useful when you want to deploy a fully self-contained application
which works in a sandboxed runtime environment

The included node binary will be, by default, the same as the used when your
create the archive (taken from `process.execPath`)

Hooks scripts that requires `node` will use the self-contained binary inside the archive.
It will be accessible via `PATH` environment variable.
If you want to use node from `package.json` hook scripts, you could simply use: `node script.js`

**Note**: the node binary is OS and platform specific.
Take this into account if you are going to deploy the archive in multiple platforms

#### binaryPath
Type: `string`
Default: `process.execPath`

Custom `node` binary path to add into the archive

You must define the `binary` option as `true` in order to apply this.
You can use interpolated environment variables expressions in
this option, like `${HOME}/binaries/node`

Aditionally, you can also define the `binaryPath` value from the `NAR_BINARY`
environment variable

#### ignoreFiles
Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`

Enable/disable [ignore-like files](#ignoring-files) processing in order to load
files patterns to discard from the archive

#### patterns
Type: `array`
Default: `['**']`

[Glob][glob] patterns for matching files to include or exclude in the archive.
OS level specific hidden files such as `.DS_Store` or `Thumbs.db` will be ignored by default

Aditionally, `nar` will ignore matched patterns defined in [ignore-like files](#ignoring-files)

### Hooks

`nar` supports application pre/post execution hooks, that are also supported by `npm`

You should define them from `package.json` in the `scripts` member (see [npm scripts][npm-scripts])

Supported hooks (by execution order):

- `prestart`
- `start`
- `stop`
- `poststop`

Configuration example:

```json
{
  "name": "app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "prestart": "mkdir -p temp/logs",
    "start": "node app --env ${ENV}",
    "stop": "rm -rf cache"
  }
}
```

#### Aditional useful features

##### Environment variables in hook commands

You can consum environment variables from hook comands using the `${VARNAME}` notation

##### Nar-specific execution environment

nar will expose the `NODE_NAR` environment variable in the hooks execution contexts and node application

You can make any environment runtime checks if your application needs a different behavior
dependending of the runtime environment

##### Ignoring files

nar will find ignore-like files in order to load
and match patterns of files to discard

Supported files by priority are (the first one found implies to ignore other ones):

- `.narignore`
- `.buildignore`
- `.npmignore`
- `.gitignore`

## FAQ

##### Which kind of archive is nar?

nar archives are just a tarball containers with gzip compression.
It's equivalent to a file with `tar.gz` extension, so you can extract
it with `tar`, `7zip` or file compression tools ans inspect the archive contents

Example using `tar`
```bash
$ tar xvfz app-0.1.0.nar
```

**Note**: this is not applied for `nar` executables, since they have another format
and not just a tarball file interface

##### Is required to have installed node or nar in order to work with nar archives?

No. From version `0.3.0` you can create executable binary-like applications containers
and there is no more required to have previously installed `node` or `nar` in order
to run, install or extract an application

You can create an executable archive simply passing a flag
```bash
$ nar create --executable
```

Then you could run it like a binary:
```bash
$ ./app-0.1.0-linux-x64.nar [run|extract|install] [options]
```

If you don't create your archive with this option, you must to have `nar`
(and consequently node) installed in the target computer

##### nar executables runs in Windows?

No. `nar` executables only can run in POSIX operative systems (GNU/Linux, Darwin or SunOS)

Is not planned to support it due to technical limitations in Windows OS

##### There is the maximum file size for nar archives?

V8 JavaScript engine (which node uses) has a heap memory limit of 1 GB. This is teorically the maximum fize limit, however, it can variadic depend on the number of files and its sizes, and also based on your machine memory resources and OS (if you are running Windows) when creating, running or extracting `nar` archives

However, `nar` was tested in real projects creating archives which contains thousands of files and which the generated archive has more than 100 MB of file size

##### Which binary is used in nar executables?

The node binary that is begin used when the `nar` archive is created

To be exactly, the binary that
[process.execPath](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_execpath) points to

That means, if you create an executable archive in OSX and then deploy it into a GNU/Linux server, it will fail.
If you want to create a `nar` archive for different OS, you must create a `nar` [executable](#executables)
passing the target OS and, optionally, the processor architecture or node.js version, like this:

```bash
nar create --executable --os linux --arch x64 --node 0.11.9
```

##### When will be used embedded node binary in the archive?

When you use the `run` command, if the archive you are running has a node binary embedded
and therefore it was created with the `binary` option set `true`,
your application will use it transparently

##### Which MIME type is recommened to serve nar files?

One of the following types will be valid:

- `application/x-gzip`
- `application/x-compress`
- `application/x-compressed`
- `application/octet-stream`

##### Can I download archives which requires server authentication?

Of course. You could use both methods:

Passing credentials via optional flags:
```
$ nar get https://server.net/archive.nar --user john --password p@s$
```

Or using the `HTTP_USER` and `HTTP_PASSWORD` environment variables
```
$ HTTP_USER=john HTTP_PASSWORD=p@s$ nar get https://server.net/archive.nar
```

## Contributing

Wanna help? Cool! It will be really apreciated :)

`nar` is completely written in LiveScript language.
Take a look to the language [documentation][livescript] if you are new with it.
and follow the LiveScript language conventions defined in the [coding style guide][coding-style]

You must add new test cases for any new feature or refactor you do,
always following the same design/code patterns that already exist
